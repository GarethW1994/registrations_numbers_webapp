<h1>REGISTRATION NUMBERS WEB-APP</h1>

http://registrations-numbers-webapp.herokuapp.com/
------------------------------------------

This app allows users to enter any registration that they like. 

It also has a filter feature, to filter all the registration numbers entered by users according to town, for example:

The user enters a registration number like, <b>CA 123 345</b>, and the registration number get's added to a list of registrations:

<ul>
	<li>CA 345 456</li>
	<li>CL 098 789</li>
	<li><b>CA 123 345</b></li>
</ul>

The user then has an option to filter the registrations by town, such as, Stellenbosch, Paarl, Cape Town etc.

If the user selects a town such as Cape Town to filter the above registrations, the output would be the following:

<ul>
	<li>CA 345 456</li>
	<li>CA 123 345</li>
</ul>

As seen in the list above the <em>filtered list</em> includes registrations from Cape Town only.
